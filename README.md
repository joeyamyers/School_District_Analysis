# Overview
## Purpose

The goal of this analysis was to aggregate a school district's test scores to showcase trends in school performance in order to help the schoolboard make decisions regarding budgets and school priorities. 

After academic dishonesty allegatations surfaced regarding Thomas High School's ninth grade, I was asked to repeat the analysis once again but with their test scores nullified. In my analysis, I have compared the two analyses in order to determine the ramificications the academic dishonesty had on Thomas High School and the district's aggregated test scores.

## Summary
Replacing the reading and math scores for the 9th grade at Thomas High School altered the initial analysis of the school district in many ways. 

The overall passing percentage for the district was slightly lowered, which would make logical sense becaude the cheaters were removed from the population.

Thomas High School went from a bottom tier ranking
